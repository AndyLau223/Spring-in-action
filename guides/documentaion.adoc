# Spring Journey

This directory is a practical guide that follows https://spring.io/guides#getting-started-guides[spring guides]


## 1. https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/[Building a RESTful Web Service]

The service will handle GET request for `/greeting`, optionally with a `name` parameter in the query string. The GET request should return `200 OK` response with JSON in the body that represents a greeting. it looks like the following output:
[source, json]
----
{
    "id": 1,
    "content": "Hello, World!"
}
----

### Run command

`./gradlew build && java -jar build/libs/01-building-restful-web-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

Let's have a close look in the command.

1. `./gradlw build`: build the java code as jar package
2. `java -jar build/libs/xx.jar`: execute the jar
